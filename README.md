# Guess Number Game: Step-by-Step:

**Start the Game**:
The game begins by welcoming the player and explaining the rules.
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated by the computer that the player needs to guess.

**Difficulty Levels**:
Easy Mode: Provides the player with 10 attempts to guess the number.
Hard Mode: Provides the player with 5 attempts to guess the number.

**Game Flow**:
->The player is prompted to choose the difficulty level at the beginning ('easy' or 'hard').
->Based on the chosen difficulty, the game determines the number of attempts allowed.
->Enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the player to input their guess.

->After each guess, the game provides feedback:
1. "Too High!" if the guessed number is higher than the secret number.
2. "Too Low!" if the guessed number is lower than the secret number.

->If the guessed number matches the secret number, the game congratulates the player and ends.
-> If the player exhausts all attempts without guessing the correct number, the game ends and reveals the secret number.
